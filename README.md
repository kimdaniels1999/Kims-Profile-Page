 Very first project in She Codes 2021 cohort for July 2021.
 
 To be honest I was not sure where to start with expressing myself on a digital forum. I just started with content and then tried to look for images online which reflected my culture. 
 
HOME PAGE - 

I was impressed to find a few free images and chose this one from - xxxxxxx  The photo on home page is a traditional maori male performing kapa haka which is the cultural dance and performance style I learnt and loved as a teenager. The performer is showing a facial expression which is a personal expression and can sometimes embody a taniwha (mystical creature of protection) and can be a means of intimidation or used to scare or frighten someone away who has not so good intentions.
 
ABOUT PAGE - 

Photo of about page shows a statue of a women called Wairaka on a rock and this famous statue is based at the river mouth in Whakatane, NZ. Wairaka was a the daughter of Toroa who was the cheif of the main waka (canoe/boat) named Mataatua. The traditional story explains how my people travelled to Aotearoa (later named New Zealand) on 7x main canoes such as Mataatua, Tainui, . Wairaka has always inspired me as she literally created the name of the town "Whaka(action of doing)-tane(Man)" which means to become a man. When the Mataatua canoe first arrived in Aotearoa the men would scout the shores before the women and chilren left the canoe, to ensure safety. The canoe started to drift to sea and Wairaka had to say a prayer to become like a man and take on male duties to correct the boat from drifting, which was not typical duties of a female and this action was normally considered tapu (taboo).
 
BLOG PAGE - 
I love butterflies so was a no brainer to use these images on both Blog and Contact pages. I personally think is has a lot to do with not just their beauty but the intricate patterns and just like human beings I think each pattern is different and unique and should be celebrated.

CONTACT PAGE - Again butterflies, and again I love using these images as the color palette is just so complimentary I wish I could use butterfly palettes in my house to decorate the interior and exterior.
