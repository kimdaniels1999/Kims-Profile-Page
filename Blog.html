            <h2>Folding washing</h2>
            <p class="blog-font">
                So learing to code is a great way to use up all the excess hours
                we seem to have as working mums. Leave the folding of washing
                for the weekend. Over use the dryer and dishwasher and order
                take out once or twice a week. Just make sure to have fruit,
                salads and ingredients for sandwhiches in the fridge. It's
                time the kids gained their independence from mum!

            <h2>Best Friends</h2>
            <p class="blog-font">
                Why is google so addictive? Do I get a sense of validation and
                even hope that one day I will be a web developer just from finding answers<br>
                through the enormity of the google search engine.
                I just think Google is the best, like that brainy kid in class <em>times</em> one thousand,
                that I just stared at in awe of their confidence, knowledge and
                understanding. All I know is that google is now my best friend.

            <h2>Computer Brain</h2>
            <p class="blog-font">
                It's exhilarating when you enter your code and your web page looks exactly as you expected.
                But just like a time warp you realise it's taken you four times longer than it should have.
                Such is the life of a student who is prepared to put in the work and fill up one's bucket
                of knowledge for coding. I feel sorry for my brain as I try and cram everything
                in at once and I have to remind myself I am not a computer.
